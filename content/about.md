## Hello there, I'm Antoine 👋

Most of my projects start the same way: **"There has to be a better way to do this."**

I believe software should be open and shareable. I enjoy building developer tooling and find great satisfaction in automating processes. I live in my terminal on Arch Linux and Hyprland; yes, with one of those vilainesque [split keyboards](https://keeb.io/products/iris-se) :)

**Recent wins:** 
- Leading the migration of a legacy .NET Framework 4.5.2 application to .NET 9.0, including architectural redesign
- Reduced deployment time by 80% by building CI/CD pipelines that automate change bundling and releases
- Saved $25K annually by building a custom ZPL label printing library that replaced expensive third-party software
- Developed internal REST APIs for data integration and cross-system communication
- Transformed PowerShell scripts into user-friendly web applications for non-technical teams

**Currently working on:**
- **Building platform tools and APIs at Algo Design**
- **[OpenLabel](https://github.com/Dwarf1er/OpenLabel)**: C# library for ZPL label printing
- **Learning Golang and exploring Rust**
