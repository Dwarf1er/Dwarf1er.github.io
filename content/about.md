## Hello there, I'm Antoine üëã

I'm a software developer who automates complex processes and builds tools that make developers' lives easier. If there's a repetitive task slowing down a team, I'm probably already thinking about how to automate it.

**Recent wins:** $25K saved with custom tooling, turning PowerShell scripts into user-friendly web apps.

**Currently working on:**
- **OpenLabel**: An open-source label printing solution that simplifies ZPL generation and management, check out the project [here!](https://github.com/Dwarf1er/openlabel)
- **Environment Variable Explorer**: An open-source cross-platform editor for environment variables, checkout the project [here!](https://github.com/Dwarf1er/environment-variable-explorer)
- **Contributing to Photino**: Helping improve the cross-platform .NET desktop framework for web-based applicactions, checkout the project [here!](https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.Blazor)
