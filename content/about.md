## Hello there, I'm Antoine üëã

Most of my projects start the same way: "There has to be a better way to do this."

I'm a software developer who builds automation tools and open-source solutions. I use Linux, write code in Neovim, and genuinely believe that good software should be transparent, modifiable, and shareable. If I'm building something useful, why shouldn't others be able to use it too?

**Recent wins:** 
- Leading the migration of a legacy .NET Framework 4.5.2 application to .NET 9.0, including architectural redesign
- Saved $25K annually by building a custom ZPL label printing library
- Transformed PowerShell scripts into user-friendly web applications for non-technical teams

**Currently working on:**
- **[OpenLabel](https://github.com/Dwarf1er/openlabel)**: An open-source label printing solution that simplifies ZPL generation and management
- **[Environment Variable Explorer](https://github.com/Dwarf1er/environment-variable-explorer)**: An open-source cross-platform editor for environment variables
